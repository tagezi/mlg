# Manual Lichen identification

This is an attempt to make a manual (not automatic) lichen identifier.

Now you can enter information into the taxon tree: taxon name, local taxon name
(Russian by default), author and year, taxon name synonyms.

![common view app](https://github.com/tagezi/mli/blob/master/files/images/common_view_01.png?raw=true)

All names, parts of lichens and other information, if possible, are given 
in Latin.

The interface can be translated into the standard way for GNU projects.
