# Manual Lichen identification

This is an attempt to make a manual (not automatic) lichen identifier.

Now you can enter information into the taxon tree: taxon name, local taxon name
(Russian by default), author and year, taxon name synonyms.

All names, parts of lichens and other information, if possible, are given 
in Latin.

The interface can be translated into the standard way for GNU projects.
